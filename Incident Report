[1] The sender address attempted to impersonate United Health Center. Analysis of the sending IP revealed that the message originated from Microsoft Outlook infrastructure, 
confirming that the email was not legitimately sent by United Health Center.

[2] The sending server IP was not blocked, as it belongs to Microsoft-owned infrastructure. Blocking this IP would likely disrupt the delivery of legitimate emails 
and could cause unintended service impact.

[3] The sender email address UHC@REWARDSBQK.COM was identified as malicious. Blocking this address would prevent further emails from this source and would not negatively impact 
legitimate communications, as the domain is not associated with any trusted or authorized sender.

[4] The sender address UHC@REWARDSBQK.COM
    was blocked on 22 January at 9:17 PM.

[5] The embedded URL resolved to the domain leaseweb.com, with IP address 81.171.12.132, geolocated to the Netherlands. Further investigation identified 
Leaseweb as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider, indicating that the attacker likely leveraged cloud-hosted infrastructure to deliver the phishing content.

[6] To mitigate potential repeat activity, the domain www.leaseweb.com was blocked at the email client level. As this analysis was conducted on a personal email account, 
blocking this domain was assessed to have no negative operational impact. 
    The domain block was implemented on 23 January at 5:28 PM.
